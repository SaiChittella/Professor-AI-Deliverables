Professor AI Deliverable:
Constructing a blog post that is similar to the one at https://dub.co/blog. This blog post is responsive to different screen sizes, as it utilizes a grid that ensures when a screen size is too small, the grid will adapt to become 2 columns. If the screen size becomes smaller than that, it will become one column. The blog posts are pulled from the headless CMS Contentful, which allows for easy blog post addition and deletion. In the navbar, there is a sleek interface that allows the user to sort through the blog posts. 

To start this project, go to your terminal and make sure that dependencies are installed. From there, run npm run dev, and the project will open. In order to add more blog posts, simply log into the Contentful CMS, and click on "Add entry". From there, you can fill out the required fields, and then refresh the page of the localhost, and another blog will appear. To delete, it is just as simple, head back to the Contentful CMS, and delete a blog post, and the code will automatically reorganize the grid to accomodate for the deletion.
